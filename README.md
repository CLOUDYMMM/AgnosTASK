## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AgnosTASK
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This keeps dependencies isolated from your system Python:
```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
Install all required libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install ChromeDriver
- Download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your Chrome browser from [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
- Extract and place the executable in a folder included in your system PATH, or in the project root directory.
- To check if it's installed correctly, run:
  ```sh
  chromedriver --version
  ```

---

## üß™ Running the Tests

To execute the main test suite:
```sh
robot Task1.robot
```
- Test results will be generated as `log.html`, `report.html`, and `output.xml` in the project directory.
- Screenshots of failures will be saved in the `screenshots/` folder.

---

## üìù Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Variables:** Update credentials, URLs, and other variables in `Task1.robot` as needed for your environment.
- **ChromeDriver Issues:** Ensure ChromeDriver and Chrome browser versions are compatible. If you see browser launch errors, update ChromeDriver.
- **Test Failures:** Check the `log.html` and screenshots for detailed error information.
- **Virtual Environment:** If you encounter import errors, make sure your virtual environment is activated.
- **Permissions:** On some systems, you may need to give execution permission to ChromeDriver:
  ```sh
  chmod +x chromedriver
  ```
